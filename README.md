# NC-News Frontend Project

-   This project was created as part of the Northcoders software development bootcamp, it consists of a front-end APP for a news system similar to Reddit, where users can post articles on different topics. The users can also post comments on the articles. Articles and topics can receive positive and negative votes from users, depending on whether they liked the content or not.
-   The project was created with JavaScript (Node.js), with React.js, Styled-components for the styling (A little bit of MUI as well), and axios.
